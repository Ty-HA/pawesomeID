## üåü Project Overview
#### PROJECT IN PROGRESS

PawesomeID is an innovative decentralized application (DApp) that creates a blockchain-based digital identity for pets. Leveraging the XRPL blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), this project aims to elevate the status of animals in our society by providing them with a secure, transparent, and self-sovereign identity.

This project started during the XRPL-Commons Aquarium program Residency in Paris (april to june 2024).

### The problem
Pet identification and medical record management are often fragmented and insecure, leading to challenges in pet care, lost pets, and potential fraud.

### Our solution
PawesomeID leverages blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to provide a unified, tamper-proof digital identity for every pet, accessible to owners and authorized veterinarians.

Elevate the status of animals in society through self-sovereign identity

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Blockchain-Powered Pet Passports**: Secure, immutable pet identities on XRPL
- **Veterinarian-Verified Identities**: Only authorized vets can create and update pet DIDs
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dashboard for vets and pet owners
- **QR Code Integration**: Quick access to pet information via mobile scanning
- **Account Abstraction**: Seamless onboarding with Kaiju wallet integration

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: XRPL (XRP Ledger)
- **Identity**: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- **Data Storage**: IPFS via Pinata - example https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXt3ACDHNofyKnfPkbDChBhMf919QeZvZrWeLwJoDFTSN
- **Wallet**: Kaiju (for account abstraction)
- **Forms**: Web3form for contact section

## üåà Impact
- **Enhanced Pet Care**: Seamless access to complete pet medical histories
- **Lost Pet Recovery**: Quick identification and reunion with owners
- **Fraud Prevention**: Tamper-proof records for pedigree and ownership
- **Global Standards**: Pushing for unified, blockchain-based pet identification


## üí° How It Works

- **Vet Authentication**: Secure login using Gmail (account abstraction) or blockchain wallet
- **Pet DID Creation**: Vets input pet data to generate a unique DID
- **Digital ID Card**: Each pet receives a QR-coded digital passport
- **Verification**: Instant access to pet info via QR code scan

## üó∫ Roadmap

-  Launch mobile app for QR code scanning and verification
- Finalization of dynamic DID Document generation
- Integration with "heirloom" DID for veterinarian login
- Integrate biometric authentication for enhanced security
- Expand to international markets and partner with major pet care brands
- Implement AI-driven health prediction based on blockchain data



## Getting Started

## Test as a veterinarian
#### Clone this repository
Then
```npm install```
and change to ```dev branch``` if you want to test to register a pet as a professional and check it on XRPL devnet.

First, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Update the .env with the example
and follow Kaiju doc: https://docs.kaiju3d.com/tutorials/xrpl/google-authentication

Go to login to test kaiju Login
```http://localhost:3000/login```

Then when you can add a pet here:
```http://localhost:3000/mypets/addNewPet```

You will see the dashboard here
```http://localhost:3000/dahsboard```
