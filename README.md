# PawesomeID, your Pet Passport DApp

## Overview

PawesomeID is an innovative decentralized application (DApp) that creates a blockchain-based digital identity for pets. Leveraging the XRPL blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), this project aims to elevate the status of animals in our society by providing them with a secure, transparent, and self-sovereign identity.

This project started during the XRPL Aquarium program Residency in Paris (april to june 2024).

## Features

- NextJS and Tailwind CSS landing page and professional dashboard
- XRPL blockchain integration
- Decentralized Identity (DID) implementation (currently on devnet)
- Account abstraction with Kaiju wallet
- Veterinarian-exclusive DID creation for pets
- QR code generation for pet identification

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Blockchain: XRPL (XRP Ledger)
- Identity: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- Pinata to Direct Link to DID Document on IPFS
- Wallet: Kaiju (for account abstraction)
- Web3form for the contact section

## How It Works

1. **Veterinarian Authentication**: 
   - Vets can log in using their Gmail account if they don't have a blockchain wallet.
   - The system creates a wallet and an issuerDID for new users.

2. **Pet DID Creation**:
   - Only authenticated veterinarians can create a DID for an animal.
   - A user-friendly form allows vets to input pet information and generate a DID.

    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Pet ID Card**:
   - Each pet receives a digital ID card containing a QR code.
   - The QR code can be scanned using a mobile app (in development) to verify the pet's identity.

## Future Developments

- Finalization of dynamic DID Document generation
- example on Pinata https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXt3ACDHNofyKnfPkbDChBhMf919QeZvZrWeLwJoDFTSN
- Integration with "heirloom" DID for veterinarian login
- Biometric authentification
- Mobile application for QR code scanning and verification

## Project Goals

1. Provide a secure and transparent identity system for pets
2. Elevate the status of animals in society through self-sovereign identity
3. Create a user-friendly interface for veterinarians to manage pet identities

## Getting Started

## If you want to test as a veterinarian
#### Clone this repository
Then
```npm install```
and change to ```dev branch``` if you want to test to register a pet as a professional and check it on XRPL devnet.


First, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is currently a Proof of Concept (POC) and uses the XRPL devnet for DID implementation, as the DID amendment is pending on the main network.
